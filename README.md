# RPG-python-
Creating a first video game using python. I'm both new to these, and i'm using this projet as a fun way to learn programmation. RPG based on random/luck, with a little bit of strategy. rule 1, if an enemy is to strong, you must leave, or die.

Alone projet but I'm using GeminiPRO as a guide to my first projet. Focusing on "how to think", "how to optimise", "how to do". Instead of copy pasting. The goal is to learn python by fun. I have no base, just stared near last 2025 months. No maths, no computing science, just pleasure and curiosity.



Things to do :
balances fight/Entities
Shop
Consummable
Skills
Optimise code + make it clearer and like a pro
Loot
dungeons with group mob (selecting attack choices) : enemy will attack the least armor character
