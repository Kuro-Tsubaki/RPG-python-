# RPG-python-
     December 2025
---
Creating a first video game using python. I'm both new to these, and I'm using this projet as a fun way to learn programming
. RPG based on random/luck, with a little bit of strategy.

- Rule 1, if an enemy is to strong, you must leave, or die. 
- Rule 2, even if you're lucky in life, you can't checkmate maths, all things in the game is based on luck, good luck ;).

Alone projet using GeminiPRO as a guide to my first projet. Focusing on "how to think", "how to optimise", "how to do". Instead of copy pasting. The goal is to learn python by fun. I have no base, just stared near last 2025 months. No maths, no computing science, just pleasure and curiosity.
